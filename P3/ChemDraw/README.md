## Why use Chemdraw?

Chemdraw is used to make the chemical sequence of the P3 molecule. We do not directly use a molecule builder like Avogardo because the molecule has chiral carbons. In Chemdraw, it is easy to account for chirality. 

Once the sequence is ready on Chemdraw, the SMILES code is copied and pasted in the Avogadro.
