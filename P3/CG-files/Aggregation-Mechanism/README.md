## List of calculations:

To better understand the mechanism of peptoid self-assembly, we have studied

1. Number of NSPE-NSPE interactions as a function time.
2. Number of PMEO-PMEO interactions as a function time.
3. Number of NLYS-NLYS interactions as a function time.
4. Number of NSPE-Water interactions as a function time.
5. Number of PMEO-Water interactions as a function time.
6. Number of NLYS-Water interactions as a function time.

**NPSE**: Chiral aromatic ring <br>
**PMEO**: Achiral aromatic ring <br>
**NLYS**: Lysine <br>

All of the above calculations are compared with number of clusters (as a function of time).
