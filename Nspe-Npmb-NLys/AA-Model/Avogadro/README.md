# Why use Avogadro?

We paste the Smiles code (generated in ChemDraw) into Avogadro. Avogadro helps us in the following ways:

1. Visualize the sequence in a 3D viewer.
2. Optimize the Gemotry.
3. Remove overlaps and unphysical effects during the optimization of geometry.
4. The final structure is obtained as a mol2 file. If required, a PDB file can also be generated.
