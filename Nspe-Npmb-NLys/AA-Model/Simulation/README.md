# How to run these simulations?

Pre-requisites:
1. All errors in the FF folder should be fixed. The updated FF should be pasted here. 


In this folder:

1. Run ./model.bash. 
2. Next run ./model_1.bash. This will be a short production run MD on your desktop. 
3. Follow this with a long production run on a supercomputer. 

*The ./driver.bash has all the bash scripts (if you want to execute all the scripts at once). This is not advisable in the first attempt as it will be difficult to  diagnose errors.)*

For step 3, the plumed data file is required. This is described in `Plumed`
