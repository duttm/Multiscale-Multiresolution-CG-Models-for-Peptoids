## Input files for CG simulation

These CG simulations require the following files: 

1. Topology (*.top)
2. Parameter file (*.mdp)
3. Index file (*.ndx)
4. Potentials (*.xvg)
5. Settings (*.xml)

It is time-consuming to build these files by hand (especially in cases where there are more than 5 beads). Hence, we have written scripts to simplify the process.
