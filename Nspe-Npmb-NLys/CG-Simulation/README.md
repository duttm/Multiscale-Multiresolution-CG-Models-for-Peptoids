# CG Simulations 

Simulation files to run the single and 64 peptoid systems are provided here. Please use the `simulation_test.bash` and `simulation_long.bash` scripts for testing and production runs, respectively. 

Please start with no more than 8 cores for each simulation. You can increase the number of cores on the basis of the performance on the HPC resource.
