# AA references

We have used these files to generate AA references for CG model development. All directoies have a bash script (*.sh) that executes a VOTCA command (`csg_stat`)
. This command will generate a reference distribution. 

In some cases, the boltzmann inverted potential is also generated. For example, check [here](Dihedrals_Backbone-Backbone/Pots)
