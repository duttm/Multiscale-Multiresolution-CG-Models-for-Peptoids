# AA references

We have used these files to generate AA references for CG model development. All directories have a bash script (*.sh) that executes a VOTCA command (`csg_stat`)
. This command will generate a reference distribution. 

In some cases, the boltzmann inverted potential is also generated. For example, check [here](Dihedrals_Backbone-Backbone/Pots)

Gnuplot files (*.p) are attached for visualization of the distributions. 


The final distribution data files are placed [here](https://github.com/duttm/Multiscale-Multiresolution-CG-Models-for-Peptoids/tree/main/Nspe-Npmb-NLys/CG-Analysis/).
